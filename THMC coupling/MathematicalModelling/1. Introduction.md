# Overview

Objective: not using the FEM code as a turn key solution
## 0. Notation

- Constants are denoted by uppercase letters: $A,B,C,D$   
- Vectors are denoted by bold letters in lower case: $\mathbf{a,b,c,v}$
- Second order tensors are denoted by greek letters and bold letter in uppercase:  $\sigma, \theta, \mathbf{H}$   
- Fourth order tensors are denoted by calligraphic letters: $\mathcal{A,B,C}$
- Vectors are denoted by lowercase letters in sans serif $\mathbb{\{U\}}$
- Matrix are denoted by uppercase letters in sans serif $\mathbb{[D]}$
  

 ## 1. Fluid flow and diffusion
    

$$

A\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} +  div(-D\nabla c) = R - \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla} c

$$
    
$A:$ 
- Storage coefficient for fluid diffusion
- Retardation coefficient for contaminant flow
## 2. Fluid mechanics

Navier-stokes equations and momentum transfer
$$
    \rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} 
    +
    \rho (\mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v} 
    = F - \nabla P + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} 
$$  

$$

\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 
$$

## 3. Solid mechanics

$$
    - \nabla \cdot (\mathcal{C} \mathbf{\sigma}) =  F
$$


## 4.Coupled process models

- Fully coupled solutions
  - via governing equations
  - via Level-set methods through indicator functions (1:1 Introduction, Timeline 50:00)
- Externally-coupled solutions
  - Sequentially-coupled overlapping meshes
  - Meshes at multiple scales - linked FEM-MD models (ex. tunnel and faults) 
  - X-FEM
- Pros and cons
  - FEM: each element can have different nonlinear constitutive laws
  - Domain methods: problem dimensions are reduced by one

## 5. Alternative number methods
- Integral methods: meshes only the boundary
- Meshless models including SPH
- Discontinuum methods
  - Block and granular mechanics models
- Automaton methods
  - Simple models of Nature   
  - Lattice-Gas automata
  
  
## 6. Element type

- Element with curve sides ( 1:1 Introduction, Timeline 56:42)
- THMC process couplings
